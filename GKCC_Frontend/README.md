## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js installed. Recommended version: 18 or higher.
2. **Package Manager**:
   - Use `npm` (comes with Node.js) or `yarn` for managing dependencies.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gkcc-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following variables:
     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=https://api.gkcc.world/api
     # Uncomment for local development:
     # NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:5001/api
     ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Build for Production**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   - Start the production server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Project Structure

### Root-Level Directories:

1. **`.next`**:

   - Automatically generated by Next.js during the build process.
   - Contains compiled files for server and client rendering.

2. **`.vscode`**:

   - VS Code-specific configuration files (if any).

3. **`node_modules`**:

   - Contains all the dependencies and libraries required for the project.

4. **`public`**:

   - Stores static assets like images, PDFs, and other resources.
     - Example folders: `asociation`, `framerSlider`, `heroslider`, `newsletter`.
     - Example files: `defaultimage.jpg`, `sponsers.jpg`.

5. **`src`**:

   - Core folder for the project code, leveraging Next.js 14's structure.

---

## Inside the `src` Folder

### `app` Directory:

- Implements Next.js' file-based routing.
- Each folder represents a route; for example:
  - `aboutus/page.jsx` renders the `/aboutus` route.
  - `[id]/page.jsx` handles dynamic routing like `/juned/123`.
- Routes are connected to components for modularity.

### `components` Directory:

- Contains reusable components categorized by their functionality:
  - **`home`**: Handles homepage UI elements.
  - **`aboutus`**: Renders the About Us section.
  - **`memberAssociation`**: Displays member details and associations.
  - **`layouts`**: Provides common layouts for pages.

### `data` Directory:

- Stores static data files used across the application:
  - **`committeeData.json`**: Contains information about committees.
  - **`associations.js`**: Stores details about associations.
  - **`districts`**: Could hold region-specific data like pin codes for forms.
- Helps in preloading data for forms, dropdowns, or rendering static UI elements.

---

## API Integration

### `axios` Configuration:

- `axios` is used for API requests.
- Backend URLs are dynamically configured using environment variables from the `.env` file:
  ```javascript
  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API}/association/getOneAssociation/${id}`
  ```

### Environment Setup:

- `.env` file example:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=https://api.gkcc.world/api
  # For local development:
  # http://localhost:5001/api
  ```
- Switch between production and development environments by updating the `.env` file.
- Use HTTPS in production and `localhost` for testing locally.

---

## Styling and Animations

### TailwindCSS:

- Configured using `tailwind.config.js`.
- Used for responsive and utility-first styling.

### Animation Libraries:

- **`framer-motion`**:
  - For adding animations to UI elements like modals or transitions.
- **`swiper`**:
  - Used for creating sliders and carousels (e.g., hero sliders).
- **`gsap`**:
  - Used for advanced animations and smooth scrolling effects.

---

## Key Features

### Routing:

- **Folder-based routing**:
  - Each folder in `app` corresponds to a route.
  - Example: `app/juned/page.jsx` translates to `/juned`.
- **Dynamic routing**:
  - Handled using `[id]` folders.
  - Example: `app/[id]/page.jsx` renders `/user/123`.

### Forms and Validation:

- **`react-hook-form`**:
  - Used for managing forms efficiently.
- **`yup`**:
  - Adds schema-based form validation.

### PDF and Signature Integration:

- **`pdf-lib`**:
  - Handles PDF generation for reports or forms.
- **`react-signature-canvas`**:
  - Captures user signatures in forms.

### Static Data:

- **Pin Codes**:
  - Used in forms to autofill region-specific data.
- **Associations and Committees**:
  - Rendered dynamically from the `data` folder.

---

## Development and Deployment Workflow

### Scripts:

- **`dev`**:
  - Starts the development server.
- **`build`**:
  - Builds the project for production.
- **`start`**:
  - Runs the production build.

### Development Tips:

- Use `localhost` for testing.
- Ensure `.env` is updated for the target environment.

### Deployment:

- Update `.env` to use HTTPS URLs for production.
- Build and deploy using `next build` and `next start`.
