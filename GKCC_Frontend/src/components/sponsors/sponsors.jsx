        Sponsors play a vital role in supporting the Global Kokani Committeesâ€™
        Council (GKCC) by enabling us to drive impactful initiatives and deliver
        essential services to our community. Through your sponsorship, you not
        only contribute to meaningful projects in education, healthcare, and
        community development but also gain the opportunity to showcase your
        brand to a wide and diverse audience. <br/>If your company is interested in
        partnering with us as a sponsor, we invite you to connect with the GKCC
        management team. Together, we can create a tailored sponsorship plan
        that aligns with your business goals and values while contributing to
        the growth and well-being of the Kokani community. To learn more or
        express your interest, please reach out to us at (we could include GKCC
        email address here). Your support can make a lasting difference.
